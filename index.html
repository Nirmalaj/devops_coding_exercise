<a id="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals</h2>

<p>The goals of the exercise are the following</p>

<ol>
<li>to show that the candidate is hands on and can write code that builds a cloud-hosted instance</li>
<li>to show that candidates can think about big picture topics like security</li>
<li>to give us a vehicle for a deeper discussion in a face to face interview setting </li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that you can write code that launches a virtual machine on Amazon Web Services running a secure ElasticSearch service.</p>

<h2>
<a id="what-to-submit" class="anchor" href="#what-to-submit" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to Submit</h2>

<ul>
<li>A zip file or link to a github repository with code that accomplishes the following: 

<ul>
<li>Brings up an AWS instance</li>
<li>Installs ElasticSearch configured in a way that requires credentials and provides encrypted communication</li>
<li>Demonstrates that it is functioning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A README file with at least the following information

<ul>
<li>Instructions that allow us to run your code</li>
<li>A description of your solution noting interesting choices you made and why you made them</li>
<li>A list of resources you consulted to accomplish the exercise</li>
<li>Feedback on the exercise and some information about how long you spent on it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="requirements" class="anchor" href="#requirements" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirements</h2>

<p>The requirements of the exercise are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Must use AWS.  The AWS free tier should be sufficient.  If your ideal solution would use additional services please include that information in your README</li>
<li>ElasticSearch access and communication must be secure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="extra-credit" class="anchor" href="#extra-credit" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Extra Credit</h2>

<p>Can you extend your code to create a cluster of 3 ElasticSearch nodes?  HINT: You will need to look at the AWS Cloud Plugin for ElasticSearch.</p>

<h2>
<a id="questions-to-facilitate-discussion-when-we-get-together" class="anchor" href="#questions-to-facilitate-discussion-when-we-get-together" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Questions (to facilitate discussion when we get together):</h2>

<ul>
<li>How did you choose to automate the provisioning and bootstrapping of the instance?  Why?</li>
<li>How did you choose to secure ElasticSearch?  Why?</li>
<li>How would you monitor this instance?  What metrics would you monitor?</li>
<li>Could you extend your solution to launch a secure cluster of ElasticSearch nodes?  What would need to change to support this use case?</li>
<li>Could you extend your solution to replace a running ElasticSearch instance with little or no downtime?  How?</li>
<li>Was it a priority to make your code well structured, extensible, and reusable?</li>
<li>What sacrifices did you make due to time?</li>
</ul>
