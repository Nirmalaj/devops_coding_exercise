{"name":"Build a Secure Cloud ElasticSearch Instance","tagline":"An exercise for devops candidates.","body":"##Goals\r\nThe goals of the exercise are the following\r\n\r\n1. to show that the candidate is hands on and can write code that builds a cloud-hosted instance\r\n2. to show that candidates can think about big picture topics like security\r\n3. to give us a vehicle for a deeper discussion in a face to face interview setting \r\n\r\n##Overview\r\nThe purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate that you can write code that launches a virtual machine on Amazon Web Services running a secure ElasticSearch service.\r\n\r\n##What to Submit\r\n- A zip file or link to a github repository with code that accomplishes the following: \r\n    - Brings up an AWS instance\r\n    - Installs ElasticSearch configured in a way that requires credentials and provides encrypted communication\r\n    - Demonstrates that it is functioning\r\n- A README file with at least the following information\r\n    - Instructions that allow us to run your code\r\n    - A description of your solution noting interesting choices you made and why you made them\r\n    - A list of resources you consulted to accomplish the exercise\r\n    - Feedback on the exercise and some information about how long you spent on it\r\n\r\n##Requirements\r\nThe requirements of the exercise are the following:\r\n- Must use AWS.  The AWS free tier should be sufficient.  If your ideal solution would use additional services please include that information in your README\r\n- ElasticSearch access and communication must be secure.\r\n\r\n##Extra Credit\r\nCan you extend your code to create a cluster of 3 ElasticSearch nodes?  HINT: You will need to look at the AWS Cloud Plugin for ElasticSearch.\r\n\r\n##Questions (to facilitate discussion when we get together):\r\n- How did you choose to automate the provisioning and bootstrapping of the instance?  Why?\r\n- How did you choose to secure ElasticSearch?  Why?\r\n- How would you monitor this instance?  What metrics would you monitor?\r\n- Could you extend your solution to launch a secure cluster of ElasticSearch nodes?  What would need to change to support this use case?\r\n- Could you extend your solution to replace a running ElasticSearch instance with little or no downtime?  How?\r\n- Was it a priority to make your code well structured, extensible, and reusable?\r\n- What sacrifices did you make due to time?","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
